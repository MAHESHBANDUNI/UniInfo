        <h1>Evolution of Private Universities in India </h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="log1">
                <p><br><br>The higher education system in India includes both private and public universities. Public universities are supported by the Government of India and the state governments, while private universities are mostly supported by various bodies and societies. Universities in India are recognized by the University Grants Commission (UGC), which draws its power from the University Grants Commission Act, 1956. In addition, 15 Professional Councils are established, controlling different aspects of accreditation and coordination. Private universities in India are regulated under the UGC (Establishment and Maintenance of Standards in Private Universities) Regulations, 2003. As Per the UGC act and these regulations, private universities are established by an act of a local legislative assembly and listed by the UGC in the Gazette upon receiving the act. As confirmed by ruling of the Supreme Court of India, recognition by the UGC is required for the university to operate. Also, per the 2003 regulations, the UGC sends committees to inspect the private universities and publishes their inspection report.

<br>
Sikkim Manipal University, notified in 1995, is the oldest Private University in India.
The UGC publishes and regularly updates the lists of private universities. As of 4 March 2022, the UGC consolidated list of universities lists 403 private universities. The earliest date of notification is that of Sikkim Manipal University, 11 October 1995. Private universities were established in 24 of the 28 states of India and in none of the 8 union territories.

<br>
Section 12 (B) of the UGC Act of 1956 also grants the UGC the right to "allocate and disburse, out of the Fund of the Commission, grants to Universities..." As such, the UGC may declare a private university as "Included under 12(B) of the UGC Act, 1956". Updates to these declarations are done in meetings of the UGC and published in the minutes.The latest list, published by the UGC on 4 March 2022, lists 24 private universities as included under 12(B).<br>
