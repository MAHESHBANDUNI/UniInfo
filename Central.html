        <h1>Evolution of Central Universities in India </h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="log1">
                <p><br><br>Central universities or union universities in India are public universities established by an Act of Parliament and are under the purview of the Department of Higher Education in the Ministry of Education. In general, universities in India are recognised by the University Grants Commission (UGC), which draws its power from the University Grants Commission Act, 1956.] In addition, 15 Professional Councils are established, controlling different aspects of accreditation and coordination. Central universities, in addition, are covered by the Central Universities Act, 2009, which regulates their purpose, powers, governance etc., and established 12 new universities. As of 31 March 2021, the list of central universities issued by the UGC includes 54 central universities. In all of the Indian states except Goa and the union regions, there are central universities including in Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, and Puducherry.

<br>Apart from the above universities, other institutions are granted the permission to autonomously award degrees. These institutes do not affiliate colleges and are not officially called "universities" but "autonomous organisations" or "autonomous institutes". They fall under the administrative control of the Department of Higher Education. These organisations include the Indian Institutes of Technology, the National Institutes of Technology, the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research, the Indian Institutes of Engineering Science and Technology, the Indian Institutes of Management, the National Law Schools, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, and other autonomous institutes.<br>
Central University, also known as the "Union University" in India, is directed and operated by the Department of Higher Education (DHE) in the Ministry of Education. Central Universities are those universities that are founded by an Act of Parliament, and these universities have been categorized under the Centre (Union Government).

<br>It is appropriate to mention here that every year, central universities conduct a Common University Entrance Examination to choose eligible candidates for admission to central universities across the nation. Did you know the Indian university system has long been patterned after the British system from colonial periods but is currently moving towards the American system? As the students are capable to transmit credits between central universities, further options are becoming available, and students are open to more additional course choices. For example, with the old system, a sociology student was not able to take a physics lesson. It should be stated that many of the Central Universities are somewhat young. In fact, some of them were founded after the year 1993.<br>

The main attributes of Central Universities you need to know are:-
<br> 1. Receive more funds from central government
<br>2. Eligibility standards in the top central universities in India is high and mandates good academic background
<br>3. Get better quality of candidates, especially via central level tests from all over the nation
<br>4. Major priority for the study of central universities on masters and doctoral program (Ph.D.)
<br> 5. Research Scholars get better pay
<br>6. Each and every university has its own chancellor and vice-chancellor; chancellor can be the President of India
<br>7. Better orientation
<br>8. Higher course fees compared to state universities.
<br>9. The curriculum or syllabus is comprehensive and well-created

<h1><u>Jawahar Nehru University, Delhi</u></h1>
<div class="cd2">
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru_University">
         <img src="Images/Jnu.jpg" alt="UniInfo.com">
</a>
<p>Jawaharlal Nehru University is the foremost university in India, and a world-renowned centre for teaching and research. Ranked number one in India by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) with a Grade Point of 3.91 (on a scale of 4), JNU was ranked no 3 among all universities in India by the National Institutional Ranking Framework, Government of India, in 2016 and no 2 in 2017. JNU also received the Best University Award from the President of India in 2017. Still a young university, established by an act of Parliament in 1966, the strength, energy, and reputation of Jawaharlal Nehru University result from the vision that ideas are a field for adventure, experimentation and unceasing quest, and that diversity of opinions are the basis for intellectual exploration. JNU is the place for the intellectually restless, the insatiably curious, and the mentally rigorous, giving them the space to grow amidst the calmness of an oasis, a green lung within the hustle and bustle and the crowds of the capital city of India.<br>
Coming into being in 1969, three years after its establishment by Parliament, JNU brought frontier disciplines and newer perspectives for old disciplines to the Indian university system. The excellent teacher-student ratio at 1:10, the mode of instruction which encourages students to explore their own creativity instead of reproducing received knowledge, and of exclusively internal evaluation, were also new to the Indian academic landscape and have stood the test of time. The very Nehruvian objectives embedded in the founding of the University – ‘national integration, social justice, secularism, the democratic way of life, international understanding and a scientific approach to the problems of society’, had built into them constant and energetic endeavour to renew knowledge through self- questioning.

<br>Apart from its regular faculty, JNU has over the years established specially designated ‘Chairs’ – Rajiv Gandhi Chair, Appadorai Chair, Nelson Mandela Chair, Dr. Ambedkar Chair, RBI Chair, SBI Chair, Sukhomay Chakravarty Chair, Environmental Law Chair, Greek Chair, Tamil Chair, and Kannada Chair. Many members of faculty and research scholars have won prestigious national and international awards for their academic work. A number of academic associations are headed by our faculty. Our expertise is highly sought after by the Government and many members of our faculty have served the Government of India in various capacities including as Ambassadors/ High Commissioners, and members of the important bodies like the Planning Commission. Many of our faculty members have also served and serve as Vice Chancellors of other universities.<br>

<h1><u>Jamia Millia Islamia, Delhi</u></h1>
<div class="cd2">
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamia_Millia_Islamia">
         <img src="Images/Jmi.jpg" alt="UniInfo.com">
</a>
<p><br>Jamia Millia Islamia, an institution originally established at Aligarh in United Provinces, India in 1920 became a Central University by an act of the Indian Parliament in 1988. In Urdu language, Jamia means ‘University’, and Millia means ‘National’. The story of its growth from a small institution in the pre-independence India to a central university located in New Delhi—offering integrated education from nursery to research in specialized areas—is a saga of dedication, conviction and vision of a people who worked against all odds and saw it growing step by step. They “built up the Jamia Millia stone by stone and sacrifice by sacrifice,” said Sarojini Naidu, the nightingale of India.<br>
Under the colonial British rule, two dominant trends joined hands and contributed towards in the birth of Jamia. One was the anti-colonial Islamic activism and the other was the pro-independence aspiration of the politically radical section of western educated Indian Muslim intelligentsia. In the political climate of 1920, the two trends gravitated together with Mahatma Gandhi as a catalyst. The anti-colonial activism signified by the Khilafat and the pro-independence aspirations symbolised by the non-cooperation movement of the Indian National Congress helped to harness creative energies and the subsequent making of Jamia Millia Islamia. Rabindranath Tagore called it “one of the most progressive educational institutions of India”. Responding to Gandhiji’s call to boycott all educational institutions supported or run by the colonial regime, a group of nationalist teachers and students quit Aligarh Muslim University, protesting against its pro-British inclinations. The prominent members of this movement were Maulana Mehmud Hasan, Maulana Mohamed Ali, Hakim Ajmal Khan, Dr. Mukhtar Ahmad Ansari, and Abdul Majid Khwaja. By a Special Act of the Parliament, Jamia Millia Islamia was made a central university of India in December 1988. In the list of the Faculties, i.e. Education, Humanities & Languages, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences. Engineering & Technology, one more Faculty - Faculty of Law, was added in 1989. Many new courses and programmes at UG and PG levels have since been added. Besides its Nine faculties, the Jamia has a number of centres of learning and research, like AJK-Mass Communication Research Centre (MCRC), Academy of International Studies etc. The Jamia is also marching ahead in the field of Information Technology (IT). It offers various undergraduate and postgraduate IT courses. Apart from this, the Jamia has a campus wide network which connects a large number of its departments and offices.<br>
