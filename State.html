        <h1>Evolution of State Universities in India </h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="log1">
                <p><br><br>In India, state universities are run and funded by the state government of each of the states of India. Following the adoption of the Constitution of India in 1950, education became a state responsibility. Following a constitutional change in 1976, it became a joint responsibility of the states and the central government. State universities are public universities run by the state government of each of the states and territories of India, and are usually established by a local legislative assembly act. The University Grants Commission (UGC), draws its power from the University Grants Commission Act, 1956. In addition, 15 Professional Councils are established, controlling different aspects of accreditation and coordination. The UGC publishes and regularly updates the lists of state universities. As of 4 March 2021, the UGC lists 443 state universities. The oldest establishment date listed by the UGC is 1857, shared by the University of Calcutta, the University of Madras and the University of Mumbai.<br>

The University of Madras, established 1857, is one of the three oldest state universities in India, the others being the University of Calcutta and the University of Mumbai.
Section 12 (B) of the UGC Act of 1956 also grants the UGC the right to "allocate and disburse, out of the Fund of the Commission, grants to Universities...". As such, the UGC categorizes state universities as either "declared fit to receive Central/UGC assistance under Section 12 (B) of the UGC Actâ€“1956", or not, and notes this status at the lists published. Updates to these declarations are done in meetings of the UGC and published in the minutes. The latest list, published by the UGC on 4 March 2022, lists 264 universities as fit to receive Central/UGC assistance.
