                <p><br><br>It includes Institute of National Importance of India. Institute of National Importance (INI) is a recognition accorded to eminent institutes in the country by the Central Government. They feature in the news often and hence, it is important to know what INIs are and what benefits an institution gets if it is granted this status. In this article, you can read all about Institutes of National Importance and also get an updated list for the IAS Exam and other government exams. The Central Government grants the status of ‘Institute of National Importance’ to premier higher educational institutions in India through an act of the Parliament.
<br>
According to the Ministry of Education, an institute of national importance is an institute that “serves as a pivotal player in developing highly skilled personnel within the specified region of the country/state”. This definition was given in the repealed Indian Institute of Technology (Kharagpur) Act, 1956 and the Indian Institutes of Technology Act, 1961. Such institutes get special funding and recognition from the Government of India. Section 22 of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956 gives ‘Degree Granting Status’ to such INIs established by an Act of Parliament for conferring or granting degrees. The first reference to ‘institute of national importance’ is given in the Constitution of India, Seventh Schedule; 63 – which says, “The institutions known at the commencement of this Constitution as the Benares Hindu University, the Aligarh Muslim University and the Delhi University; the University established in pursuance of article 371E; any other institution declared by Parliament by law to be an institution of national importance.” Unfortunately, the criteria for awarding the status of ‘institute of national importance’ and the particular benefits institutions receive on getting this status are not mentioned in any document. It is observed that generally, such INIs operate outside the University Grants Commission’s ambit and enjoy certain advantages related to taxes. They are also largely supervised and funded by the Government of India through the Education Ministry (formerly the Ministry of Human Resources Development).<br>
As of July 2022, there are 161 Institutes of National Importance under various Acts of Parliament. These INIs include: 23 IITs, 15 AIIMSs, 20 IIMs, 31 NITs, 25 IIITs, 7 IISERs, 7 NIPERs, 5 NIDs, 3 SPAs, 2 NIFTEMs, 5 Central universities, 4 Medical research institutes, and 14 other specialized institutes.<br>

<p><br>The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are central government owned public technical institutes located across India. They are under the ownership of Ministry of Education, Government of India. They are governed by the Institutes of Technology Act, 1961, which has declared them as Institutes of National Importance and lays down their powers, duties, and framework for governance as the country's premier institutions in the field of Technology. The Institutes of Technology Act, 1961 currently lists twenty-three IITs. Each IIT is autonomous, linked to the others through a common council (IIT Council), which oversees their administration. The Minister of Education, India is the ex officio Chairperson of the IIT Council.
On 15 September 1956, the Parliament of India passed the Indian Institute of Technology (Kharagpur) Act, declaring it as an Institute of National Importance. On the recommendations of the Sarkar Committee, four campuses were established at Bombay (1958), Madras (1959), Kanpur (1959), and Delhi (1961). The Indian Institutes of Technology Act was amended to reflect the addition of new IITs. Student agitations in the state of Assam made Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi promise the creation of a new IIT in Assam. This led to the establishment of a sixth institution at Guwahati under the Assam Accord in 1994. In 2001, the University of Roorkee was converted into IIT Roorkee..<br>
In 2008 to 2009, eight new IITs were set up in Gandhinagar, Jodhpur, Hyderabad, Indore, Patna, Bhubaneswar, Ropar, and Mandi. Following same selection process since 1972, in 2012 the Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University was made a member of the IITs and renamed as IIT (BHU) Varanasi.

In 2015 to 2016, six new IITs in Tirupati, Palakkad, Dharwad, Bhilai, Goa, and Jammu, approved through a 2016 bill amendment, were founded, along with the conversion of Indian School of Mines Dhanbad into IIT (Indian School of Mines),Dhanbad.

<p>Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs) are a group of premier public research institutions in India. The institutes were established by the Government of India through the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) to provide collegiate education in basic sciences coupled with research at the undergraduate level. The institutes were formally established by the Parliament of India through the National Institutes of Technology, Science Education and Research (Amendment) Act, 2010 (an amendment to the National Institutes of Technology Act, 2007). Seven IISERs have been established across the country, namely IISER Kolkata in West Bengal, IISER Pune in Maharashtra, IISER Mohali in Punjab, IISER Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh, IISER Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, IISER Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh, and IISER Berhampur in Odisha. All IISERs were declared as Institutes of National Importance by the Parliament of India in 2012, to promote them as leading institutions in the country in the field of basic sciences along with its sister institutes like Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar. The financial outlay for each IISER is around ₹5 billion (US$63 million) for the first five years of establishment.<br>
